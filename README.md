# Shifts-Creator

Shifts Creator
Its purpose is to allow the creation of shifts for a week automatically,
The user has to enter the constraints for that week,
and the software builds the shifts and creates an Excel file with the week's shifts.
The software makes sure that there is no duplication,
and that there is an equal division between all the employees for less convenient shifts,
for (Example: Saturday night). For this purpose, information from all previous weeks is saved in the database,
and when the software is asked to create a new week, it considers the previous information.
